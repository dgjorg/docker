Windows 10: How to setup NAT network for Hyper-V guests?

Windows 10 Hyper-V has NAT (Network Address Translation) network feature, but it needs to setup using PowerShell now.  I will show you step by step instructions how to do it. NAT Switch provides Internet access to the VM without creating External Switch (linking the switch to physical wired or wireless adaptor).

Before we start, here are the requirements to prepare it ahead of time.

1.  IP Network to be used in Guests. You need to find a subnet that is not being using in your Office network. If you are setting up on your Home, you can choose any subnet that is not used in your home. E.g., 192.168.200.0/24

2. Guest VMs are needed to assign IP address/subnet/gateway manually from the subnet you choose on requirement 1 above. Or you may need to setup in DHCP server in one of the Guest VMs for automatic IP assignment. If you only have one or two guest VMs, you may set the IP address manually on NICs.

Now the step by step instruction.
Step 1: Open PowerShell with Administrative privileges.

Search PowerShell in Start menu search, right click on PowerShell and choose More ==> Run As Administrator.
Step 2: Create Hyper-V internal only switch.

Run this command on the PowerShell.

    New-VMSwitch –SwitchName “NAT-Switch” –SwitchType Internal –Verbose

Step 3: Find the Interface Index number

Type this cmdlet and note down the interface index (ifIndex) for NAT-Switch adaptor.

    Get-NetAdapter

Step 4: Create NAT Gateway

Run this cmdlet. Replace

    IP Address (gateway) with your own (should be from the network subnet you chose in the requirements section above)
    PrefixLength is the subnet mask number for the subnet you chose
    Interface index you noted down on previous step.

    New-NetIPAddress –IPAddress 192.168.200.1 -PrefixLength 24 -InterfaceIndex 16 –Verbose

Step 4: Create NAT Network

Run this cmdlet and replace InternelIPInterfaceAddressPrefix with your chosen network.

    New-NetNat –Name NATNetwork –InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix 192.168.200.0/24 –Verbose

Step 5: Connect your VM to the NAT-Switch

You may manually assign the Guest NIC to the “NAT-Switch” which we created in Step-2.  Or you may run this cmdlet to assign NIC from all Guest VMs to the “NAT-Switch”

    Get-VM | Get-VMNetworkAdapter | Connect-VMNetworkAdapter –SwitchName “NAT-Switch”

Step 6: Assign IP Address to the NICs in Guests

Open NIC properties in your Guest VMs, Assign IPv4 addresses from the network subject you setup in Step-4.  Or run DHCP server from one of your Guests to dish IP address automatically.

E.g.,

Guest VM 1:

IP Address: 192.168.200.11
Subnet: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.200.1
DNS: 4.2.2.2 and 8.8.8.8 (or your own DNS server from the office network).

Guest VM 2:

IP Address: 192.168.200.12
Subnet: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.200.1
DNS: 4.2.2.2 and 8.8.8.8 (or your own DNS server from the office network).

That’s all. By  now you guests should have access to External networks and Internet.

Hope this helped you. Leave me a reply below. \




Configure CentOS 6 Network Settings
Overview

This tutorial will walk you through configuring your network configurations on CentOS 6.X. There are three different methods to choose from, depending on what installation type and packages you have installed.

Manual configuration is done by directly modifying the configuration files. You will need to be comfortable with the command-line for this one. However, this will give you the most flexibility and is worth learning.

System Config Network is a command-line tool that presents a very basic graphical interface. This a great tool for those who just want to quickly configure the network and do not require advanced features, like interface bonding (teaming).

And lastly, from a Gnome desktop. This is for those trying Linux out, who have yet to venture into command-line territory, or have no interest in it at all.
Manual Configuration

This configuration is done by modifying the network configuration directly, using a text editor. This method is typical for servers and is a more advanced way of doing it.
Set the Hostname

    Open the following file into a text editor, like VI or Nano.

    vi /etc/sysconfig/network

    Change the hostname value to the fully qualified name of your computer.

    HOSTNAME=slcentos6-01.serverlab.intra

    Save your changes and exit the text editor. The new name will be applied after your next reboot.

Set a DHCP Address

    Open the configuration file for the first network interface, eth0, into a text editor.

    vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

    Modify the file to look similar to the example below.

    DEVICE=eth0
    TYPE=Ethernet
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=dhcp
    IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=yes
    NAME="System eth0"

    Save your changes and exit the text editor.
    Restart the network service.

    service network restart

Set a Static IP Address

    Open the configuration file for the first network interface, eth0, into a text editor.

    vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

    Modify the configuration file to look similar to the one below. Remember to change the highlighted values to match your environment’s.

    DEVICE=eth0
    TYPE=Ethernet
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR=172.30.0.53
    PREFIX=24
    GATEWAY=172.30.0.1
    IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=yes
    NAME="System eth0"

    Save your changes and exit the text editor.
    Restart the network service.

    service network restart

Setting DNS Name Servers

DNS configurations are set in /etc/resolv.conf. Within this file, we can specify the search domains and the name servers. The search domains are used as default suffixes when no domain is added to a hostname.

    Open the resolvr configuration file into a text editor.

    sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf

    Add the following lines, modifying it them to match your environment.

    domain example.com
    search example2.com lab.example2.com
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4

    Save your changes and exit the text editor.
    All changes to resolvr.conf are applied immediately.

Using the System Config Network Tool

The System Config Network tool is a terminal application that presents a very basic GUI. It can do basic network configurations, such as configuring static or DHCP addresses, setting the DNS server IP addresses, and setting the default gateway.
Install System Config Network

The base CentOS 6 installation includes the tool by default. To install it on a minimal installation, follow these instructions.

    Install it from the yum repository.

    yum intall system-config-network

    If you have no Internet access, install it from the CentOS DVD. Create a directory in /media called cdrom.

    mkdir -p /media/cdrom

    Mount the CentOS DVD to the directory.

    mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom

    Run yum and target the repository that uses the DVD.

    yum --disablerepo=/* --enablerepo=c6-media install system-config-network



Log in to your server as the root user.

    ssh root@server_ip_address

Use the adduser command to add a new user to your system.

Be sure to replace username with the user that you want to create.

    adduser username

    Set and confirm the new user's password at the prompt. A strong password is highly recommended!

    Set password prompts:
