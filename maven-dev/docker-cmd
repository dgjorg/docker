# Delete all untagged images, used ones as well when the container using them is stopped 
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q --filter "dangling=true")

# Delete all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# Delete all images
docker rmi $(docker images -q)

# Remove all stopped containers
$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

# Stop all running containers
$ docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
  
Here is a breakdown of docker ps -a -q
    docker ps list containers
    -a the option to list all containers, even stopped ones. Without this, it defaults to only listing running containers
    -q the quiet option to provide only container numeric IDs, rather than a whole table of information about containers
